# 0x00. Pascal's Triangle

## Welcome to the Pascal's Triangle challenge! In this project, we explore the fascinating world of Pascal's Triangle.
### Challenge Description
Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of integers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. In this challenge, we will be solving Pascal's Triangle and providing a function pascal_triangle(n) that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal's Triangle of n.

### This challenge has been graciously provided by Alexa Orrico, a talented Software Engineer at Holberton School.

## Tasks:
Your task is to implement the pascal_triangle(n) function. It should take a single parameter n and return a list of lists, where each list represents a row of Pascal's Triangle.

Feel free to explore, learn, and have fun with this exciting challenge!

Happy coding!
